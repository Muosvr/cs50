Todo
-open memory card file (fopen)
- finding beginning of JPEG
- open a new JPEG
- write 512 byte until new JPEG is found
- detect end of file

fread(data, size, number, inptr)

identifying beginning of JPEG
if (buffer[0] == 0xff &&
buffer[1] == 0xd8 &&
buffer[2] == 0xff &&
(buffer[3] & 0xf0) == 0xe0) //this line of code use a bitwise AND operator to manipulate the bits into appropriate format for comparing

making a new JPEG
filenames: ###.jpg
named in the order in which they are found, starting at 000.
+
sprintf(filename, "%03i.jpg", 2); //filename: char array to store the resultant string 002.jpg
FILE *img = fopen(filename, "w")
+
writing files
fwrite(data, size, number, outptr)

End of File EOF
fread(data, size, number, inptr);
- returns how many items of size <size> were read (ideally, it returns number)
- use it directly in a condition

pseudocode
open card file
repeat until end of card
    read 512 bytes into a buffer
    start of a new JPEG?
        yes ->
        no ->
    already found a JPEG?
        no ->
        yes ->
close any remaining files
